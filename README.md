# NodeAssignment

In my assignment the logic is pretty basic:

1. Each node remembers it's own state.
2. Each node has list of dependent nodes (called NextNodes)
3. If player clicks on the node and it's state is open - state changes to complete and visuals are changing automaticly
4. Additional code that draw Connection Lines between nodes on Scene Start to provide more user friendly experience
